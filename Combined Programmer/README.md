<h1 align="center">Combined programmer</h1>

<p align="left">Programmer created for my own needs. It consists of a USB hub and ICSP, Serial and UPDI programmers. The additional USB port is the result of a free port on the USB hub. On the programmer itself, you can switch voltage levels with sliders. The input is USB-C</p>
